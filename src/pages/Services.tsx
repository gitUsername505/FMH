    At the Fractured Hearts Counseling, we offer a range of services to meet the needs of survivors of trauma. Here are some of the ways we can help:
  </p>

<h2>Support Groups</h2>
  <p style={{marginBottom: '40px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
We offer support groups for survivors of Satanic Ritual Abuse and other forms of trauma. These groups provide a safe and supportive environment where survivors can share their experiences and find healing together.
  </p>

<h2>Prayer Sessions</h2>
  <p style={{marginBottom: '40px', fontSize: '20px'}}>
  Our prayer person provides Christ led individual sessions to survivors of trauma. We use Christ to help survivors heal from their past and build a brighter future.
  </p>


<h2>Resource Library</h2>
  <p style={{marginBottom: '40px', fontSize: '20px'}}>

  Our resource library contains a wealth of information on trauma and healing. We offer books, articles, videos, and other resources to help survivors and their loved ones understand the effects of trauma and find ways to heal.
